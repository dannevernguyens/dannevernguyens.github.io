## Welcome to Daniel's Github

_Where it's not about Nguyening. It's about showing up._

# Growth Mindset

To me, having a growth mindset is about relentlessly wanting to be better, in any way possible. It's about not giving up before seeing something through to the end. 

**3 Reminders:**
1. Compare yourself only to yourself
2. Be better than yesterday
3. Stay hard

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dannevernguyens/dannevernguyens.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dannevernguyens/dannevernguyens.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
