I will be using this space to house my Code Fellows course work. Tune in for periodic school-ish updates.

## Growth Mindset

To me, having a growth mindset is about relentlessly wanting to be better, in any way possible. It's about iterating on past mistakes. It's about having the patience to see small improvements over a long period of time. And the willingness to put in consistent effort to see those results pay off. 

As Bruce Lee once said:

> I believe that anybody can think himself into his goal if he mixes 
> thought with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a burning
> desire for its translation into reality

**3 Reminders:**
1. Compare yourself only to yourself
2. Be better than yesterday
3. Stay hard
