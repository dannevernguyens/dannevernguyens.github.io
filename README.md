## Welcome to Daniel's Github

_Where it's not about Nguyening. It's about showing up._

## Growth Mindset

To me, having a growth mindset is about relentlessly wanting to be better, in any way possible. It's about not giving up before seeing something through to the end. 

**3 Reminders:**
1. Compare yourself only to yourself
2. Be better than yesterday
3. Stay hard

## About Me

- I was overweight. 
- I was shy. 
- I was depressed. 
- I was a quitter. 

So!

- I lost weight. 
- I expanded my narrow boundaries. 
- I (mostly) rid myself of depression and anxiety.
- I build a stronger mindset

I have already made great changes in my personal life. And now I would like to make changes in my work life. So here we are. Let's go!

## End Intro

# Begin Learning Blog - Code 102 #

### Class 01 ###

Today we simply introduced ourselves and got our github pages built. The prof was Brian Nations. He helped give us a lay of the land and set expectations going forward. I'm excited to go on this journey!

### Class 02 ###

Today we went over The Terminal aka The Command Line. Our prof was Amanda Iverson. That shit was nuts! I feel like I have to relearn how to use a computer all over again. 

**Commands**
- pwd = present working directory, to orient yourself!
- ls = list, to show you a list of files in your current directory
- cd = change directory, prefix to jump into the following directory
- clear = clears the terminal screen of previous commands and returns
- cd .. = go back 1 file level
- mkdir = make directory, prefix to create a file named whatever follows the prefix
- cp = copy, prefix to copy the following file to a directory
- touch = touch, prefix to create a file
- mv = move, prefix followed by directory to move a file somewhere

We then spent the rest of the class reading about text editors and I even got to set up my machine with an improved Terminal and VS Code! These are pretty cool and instantly made me feel more techy.
