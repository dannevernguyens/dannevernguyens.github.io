## Welcome to Daniel's Github

_Where it's not about Nguyening. It's about showing up._

## Growth Mindset

To me, having a growth mindset is about relentlessly wanting to be better, in any way possible. It's about not giving up before seeing something through to the end. 

**3 Reminders:**
1. Compare yourself only to yourself
2. Be better than yesterday
3. Stay hard

## About Me

- I was overweight. 
- I was shy. 
- I was depressed. 
- I was a quitter. 

So!

- I lost weight. 
- I expanded my narrow boundaries. 
- I (mostly) rid myself of depression and anxiety.
- I build a stronger mindset

I have already made great changes in my personal life. And now I would like to make changes in my work life. So here we are. Let's go!
