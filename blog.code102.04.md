### Reading & Lab 04 - HTML Structure
##### August 24, 2019 - Saturday

Now we are reviewing HTML

HTML 3 vs HTML 5
5 uses “main, nav, section” as clearer versions of div
Also includes many other modern syntax updates

HTML page hierarchy:
- \<!DOCTYPE html>\
- \<html>\
- head
- title
- Body
- Header
- H1
- Main
- section
- Article
- \<p\>
- /contents/
- footer

Now we are reading Duckett’s HTML starting at Chapter 18

# READING 04 Notes - HTML

WHO
When designing a site, you must think about the target audience as you conceptualize your site structure. That way you can cater the site’s design to that specific audience. 

WHY
You must also consider WHY people will be visiting your site. Their specific motivations and goals can also influence your site’s design and functionality.

WHAT
Consider what kind of info your visitors what. Then provide that for them! Or at least make it easy for them to find. 

HOW OFTEN
Some sites benefit from being updated often. This kind of thing will depend on how often you predict your users will be frequenting your site. Figuring out how often folks will be visiting your site can give you input on how often you should be updating your site. 

SITE MAPS
A site map is a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This will show how all the pages of your site are grouped together. To help decide what info should go on each page, you can use a technique called **CARD SORTING**.

This involves actual pieces of paper! Place each piece of info your visitors might need on a diff piece of paper and then organize all of them into related groups. You can then turn those groups of into diagram know as a site map!

These site maps typically look like org charts. 

WIREFRAMES
A wireframe is just a sketch of the key info that needs to go on each page. It shows the hierarchy of info and how much space each element will require. This is more UXish but doesn’t include info like CSS - color, fonts, images, etc. This is to help ensure design and function mix well. 

Diff from a MOCKUP. Wireframe is a rough draft. Mockup is like a final staged version of the page with live elements - should be example of what the user will see in final build (pixel perfect). 

Wireframe = messy
Mockup = clean

VISUAL HIERARCHY
Most users do not read, they skim. So you need to present the hierarchy if your information visually, to help them quickly find what they need. Or what you want them to read! (Not always the same thing). 

Viz hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. You do this by adding visual contrast between items on display. Higher contrast items are recognized and processed first. 

This is achieved by modifying:
- size
- color
- style

Grouping and Similarity:
- proximity
- closure
- continuance
- White space
- color
- borders

Designing Navigation
- concise: try to limit nav to no more than 8 links
- Clear: nav links should be descriptive enough to give users Clear idea of where the link will take them
- selective: nav should only reflect important sections of the site - don’t link out to privacy policies on main nav
- Context: good nav provides context, so user always knows where they are, kinda like pwd
- Interactive: each link should be big and clear enough to interact with, also nice if visual indicator changes during mouseover
- Consistent: keep nav bars consistent across site

HTML 5 Readings
In reading this, I realized that my work uses <div> everywhere and it’s a kind of outdated methodology. 

Elements:
- header
- footer
- nav
- Article
- Aside
- Section
- hgroup (heading groups)
- Figure, figcaption (figures)
- Div (sectioning element)
