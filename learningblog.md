# Begin Learning Blog - Code 102 #

### Class 01 

Today we simply introduced ourselves and got our github pages built. The prof was Brian Nations. He helped give us a lay of the land and set expectations going forward. I'm excited to go on this journey!

### Class 02 

Today we went over The Terminal aka The Command Line. Our prof was Amanda Iverson. That shit was nuts! I feel like I have to relearn how to use a computer all over again. 

**Commands**
- pwd = present working directory, to orient yourself!
- ls = list, to show you a list of files in your current directory
- cd = change directory, prefix to jump into the following directory
- clear = clears the terminal screen of previous commands and returns
- cd .. = go back 1 file level
- mkdir = make directory, prefix to create a file named whatever follows the prefix
- cp = copy, prefix to copy the following file to a directory
- touch = touch, prefix to create a file
- mv = move, prefix followed by directory to move a file somewhere

We then spent the rest of the class reading about text editors and I even got to set up my machine with an improved Terminal and VS Code! These are pretty cool and instantly made me feel more techy. 

### Class 03 

#### Code 102 - Class 3

**Goals:** 
-brush up on Markdown and Terminal
-Build on GitHub repo
-Clone repo to machine for local work

Git and github
-Git is a version control system
-Allows multiple devs to work on same code base
-Keeps history of file changes
-Lets you view/apply/remove changes
-Keeps all project files in one repo
-Makes collaboration possible
-Git lives on your machine
-Git hub is the online space for ppl’s gits

Github
-Online space for sharing code
-Allows version tracking
-Allows reviewing changes
-Keeps changes separate until you want to add them in
-This is called “branching” | “master branch"
-Allows you to work offline and push work online when you can


Commit = snapshot of that file, kinda like Save As
-Kinda like save files for video games
-“Head” is your most current version - means “you are here"
-You can assign captions/messages to commits - file descriptions
-You should always include messages for commits

Repositories 
-Collection of files you tell Git to pay attention to
-One project = one repo
-Really large projects might have multiple repos for diff parts of their system (EX: front end vs backend)
-Repos can live on GitHub AND your machine

WHAT WE DID
-Made a class repo on github
-Downloaded it to our machines
-Tied them together

Git commands
-Git status
--Returns status of git repo
-Git add xxx
--Tells git to add a file to master
-Git commit -m “xxx”
--This tells git to save the commit and adds ‘xxx’ as a message for the commit
-Git push origin master
--Pushes commit to the master branch 
-Git pull
--Grabs stuff from the GitHub repo and syncs it to local repo


JARGON
-Deployment
--Adding code to production
-Merge conflicts!
--When local and online code don’t sync correctly and you have to cherry pick stuff to get them to match
-ACP
--Add, commit, push

HOMEWORK
-Make homepage table of contents
-Make a new file for each of the days readings
