### Class 02
## August 21, 2019 - Wednesday

Today we went over The Terminal aka The Command Line. Our prof was Amanda Iverson. That shit was nuts! I feel like I have to relearn how to use a computer all over again. 

**Commands**
- pwd = present working directory, to orient yourself!
- ls = list, to show you a list of files in your current directory
- cd = change directory, prefix to jump into the following directory
- clear = clears the terminal screen of previous commands and returns
- cd .. = go back 1 file level
- mkdir = make directory, prefix to create a file named whatever follows the prefix
- cp = copy, prefix to copy the following file to a directory
- touch = touch, prefix to create a file
- mv = move, prefix followed by directory to move a file somewhere

We then spent the rest of the class reading about text editors and I even got to set up my machine with an improved Terminal and VS Code! These are pretty cool and instantly made me feel more techy.
