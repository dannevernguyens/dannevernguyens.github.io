# About Me

- I was overweight
- I was shy
- I was depressed
- I was a quitter 

But then I decided to be better.

- I lost weight
- I expanded my narrow boundaries
- I overcame depression and anxiety
- I built a stronger mindset

I have already made great changes in my personal life. Now I would like to make changes in my work life. Because challenges are like donuts. And I love destroying donuts. Let's go! :metal:
